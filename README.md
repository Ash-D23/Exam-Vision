# Exam-Vision

## Digitalization of Evaluation process based on Computer Vision

This app is a prototype of the Exam Assisstant we plan to make so that we can assisst the teachers 
during evaluation of exams and detect keywords and give marks accordingly.This app make use of the 
Microsoft Cognitive services OCR for converting handwritten images to text and detect the matching
keywords present.Firebase storage is used to store images and AN Node JS api is used to extract the
text from this image and send the response.Currenty work is on progress as we plan to implement 
OpenCV with our trained OCR to process the image and send the response
